#### Software Install and Data download #####

This file have the instructions to replicate the RNA-seq course analysis on any unix OS system (iOS or Linux). To install all the bioinformatics tools required for this course, please follow the instructions to install conda from https://conda.io/miniconda.html. After conda is successfuly installed, please open a terminal window and enter the following commands: 


1.- First, you need to add the bioconda channels. Run the following commands:
        conda config --add channels r
        conda config --add channels defaults
        conda config --add channels conda-forge
        conda config --add channels bioconda
2.- Create a new conda enviroment with the software needed for the course:
        conda create -n RNASEQ snakemake hisat2 subread sra-tools
3.- Activate the conda enviroment:
        source activate RNASEQ
4.- Create a course folder and enter the it:
        mkdir RNASEQ
        cd RNASEQ
5.- Create a data folder:
      mkdir FASTQ
6.- Copy the following files inside the RNASEQ folder:
      -download_data.sh : This file have the commands to download the data.
      -Snakefile: Master file to run map RNA-seq data to the genome and get the gene count tables.
      -Analysis_Notebook.Rmd : R-markdown script to follow the data anlysis.
      -SraRunTable.txt 
7.- Now we need to download the FASTQ data (4.3G in TOTAL). Make sure you are inside RNASEQ folder and run the following command:
      bash download_data.sh
      
      

If you want to skip the RNA-seq mapping and gene count process, follow these instructions above:

1.- Create a course foder and enter it: 
        mkdir RNASEQ
        cd RNASEQ
2.- Copy Analysis_Notebook.Rmd and SraRunTable.txt inside the RNASEQ folder.
3.- Create a folder inside RNASEQ named featureCounts:
        mkdir featureCounts
4.- Copy TOTAL.gene_count.txt inside RNASEQ/featureCounts



## DATA Analysis ###


To start the data analysis install Rstudio from https://www.rstudio.com/. Then open R studio and open Analysis_Notebook.Rmd, which has all the information to run the analysis.

Any questions regarding the material, please send an email to gp7@sanger.ac.uk

Best,
